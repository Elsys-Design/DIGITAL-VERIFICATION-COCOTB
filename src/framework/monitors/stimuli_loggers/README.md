## Stimuli loggers
A StimuliLogger is a special kind of subscriber to AnalysisPorts.
It's used to log Stimuli objects (and their Data objects) to a directory.

There are 2 kinds of Stimuli loggers: EfficientStimuliLogger and RealTimeStimuliLogger.
EfficientStimuliLogger is the one that is well tested.
It supports the specific logging format of Stimulis generated by an AxiStreamMonitor that monitors a bus with no tlast.
It's efficient because it only writes the Stimuli objects to files when it's asked to (usually at the end of the
simulation).

RealTimeStimuliLogger is not tested properly for now.
It doesn't support the specific logging format of Stimulis generated by an AxiStreamMonitor that monitors a bus with
no tlast.
It's real time because whenever it receives a Stimuli object, it'll directly add it to the JSON file and write the Data
file if needed.
However, instead of writting everything at once, it writes multiple times the JSON file, adding new json objects and
it might slow the simulation down.
Most importantly, it's a bit harder (and less intuitive) to implement.


### Output directory structure
- `stimulis.json`: contains a description of all the Stimuli objects logged
- `_name_.dat`: associated data files, the `_name_` is the ID of the Stimuli
