## Random tests
Random creation of a DataList
-> Printing it to tmp file
-> Parsing this tmp file into a DataList
-> Comparing the generated DataList with the parsed one


Doesn't work with Stimulis because the parsing format (for inputs) and the printing format (for monitor logs) isn't the
same (some fields are present only in inputs, others only in output)
