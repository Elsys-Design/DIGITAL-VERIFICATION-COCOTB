## Error tests

These tests verify that the parsing methods don't let a badly formatted file be parsed without raising an exception.

All the test files should be badly formatted and the single main.py test verifies that parsing each file results in an
exception.


### TODO
Stimuli files parsing needs to be tested for errors too
